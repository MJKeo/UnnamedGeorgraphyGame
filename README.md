# UnnamedGeorgraphyGame
Idk, time to study for my 4th grade final again?

## How to Play
Download `GeographyGame.py` individually by clicking on the file and pressing the "Download raw file" button
- Try to save it to either `Desktop` or `Downloads`, wherever is easy to access from the terminal

Quit and reopen your terminal. Use the `cd` command to get to the folder where the file is located
- (Ex. If I have it saved in the `Documents` folder I'd run `cd ./Documents/`)


You can verify that you're in the right place by entering the `ls` command and checking if `GeographyGame` appears in the list of files in that folder

Run the following command
```
python GeographyGame.py
```

Enjoy the game!
